## Instructions
I think that your instructions for the output image were as follows: 

First create a canvas to the desired size and put a gradient from light blue to dark blue on top, shifting the color values slightly for each row designated to be a certain number of pixels. Next the size and color of the triangles are determined as well as the space between each that serves as the border is calculated. Then the triangles are given the pattern they will need to repeat, and instructions to decrease the opacity with each row up. Then coordinates for each triangle in input to be colored black in order.

## Output 
The instructions match the final output to a tee. The way the slow gradient of red takes over the image, alongside the beautiful meshing of the triangles, allowing them to fill up the whole space, create a very pleasing composition. The visual complexity of the central focus, the bat, also took full advantage of the triangle medium created by the initial instructions.

## Code Review
The code itself is incredibly well condensed and clear. As someone who struggles to understand most code, thanks to the brevity and effectiveness of the code, I was able to understand it quickly. A specific point of interest to me was the manner in which the triangles were reflected upon one another to create the pattern and then how the gradient was applied to them all collectively.
